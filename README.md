# WIP-frontend
Frontend rep for "Work in Progress"

8/1/2025

Work so far:
- Established project skeleton with React (TypeScript) and Vite for fast development builds.
- Integrated Mantine v7 for UI components and theming.
- Implemented base routing structure using React Router.
- Created initial layout components:
    - Header (navigation bar and top bar)
    - Footer
    - Layout for consistent page padding and structure.
- Set up initial pages (Home, About, Blog, RecruiterLogin, StudentLogin) for navigation flow testing.

Issues:
- Styling needs a lot of work. I have an idea on how I want it to look, but execution will take some time.
- Also need to begin adding student/recruiter login pages and api integration for content fetching.
